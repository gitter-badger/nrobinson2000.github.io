I created this blog on 18/10/2015 after I found out about Jekyll.  This website is powered by Jekyll
and is a repository on my GitHub account.  I am really liking Jekyll so far.  Jekyll is basically
a ruby gem that automatically builds a static website for you.  All you need to do is create HTML layouts,
customize the config file and write Markdown posts.  I can write my posts in Atom and have them automatically built by Jekyll.

I am using Travis CI to test my blog, an I am hosting my blog on GitHub pages.  I think that this is the best blog solution that I have found.  

Jekyll works really effectively.
